> Search over 1,000,000 recipes, make items list, save as favorite, and many more....

> **Project Made in ES6/ES7 with use of Webpack, node js & Babel.**

> As project is made using Webpack there is only one javascipt file named "bundle.js".

> I learned few new concepts of javascript like MVC pattern development, ES6 modules, ES7 async await, axios API, efficient ways to handle event using closets, match, state management using HTML 5 localStorage, etc

> I made this project as part of my Javascript course on Udemy :- [The Complete JavaScript Course 2018: Build Real Projects!](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/)
